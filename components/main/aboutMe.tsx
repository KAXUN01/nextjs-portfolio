          Hi, I'm <span className="font-bold">CodeBucks</span>, a web developer
          and UI/UX designer with a passion for creating beautiful, functional,
          and user-centered digital experiences. With 4 years of experience in
          the field, I am always looking for new and innovative ways to bring my
          clients' visions to life.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-50 mb-4">
          I believe that design is about more than just making things look
          pretty â€“ it's about solving problems and creating intuitive, enjoyable
          experiences for users.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-50 mb-4">
          Whether I'm working on a website, mobile app, or other digital
          product, I bring my commitment to design excellence and user-centered
          thinking to every project I work on. I look forward to the opportunity
          to bring my skills and passion to your next project.
        </p>
